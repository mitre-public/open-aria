         *
         * The suspicion was that there was some time value between 18:54:54.037 (the time of the

         * value was corrupted some way. My guess was that the out-of-time-order result was an
         * artifact of the "convert an Instant to a String" code.
         *
         * This test rejects that suspicion and confirms that all Instants (using a msec resolution)
         * are parsed correctly. Consequently, the source of the out-of-order input is still
         * unexplained.
