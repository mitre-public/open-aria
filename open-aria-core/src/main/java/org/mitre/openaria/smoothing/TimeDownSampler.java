/**
 * A TimeDownSampler will "thin out" a Track with a high-update rate (ie too many points per
 * minute). Reducing the number/frequency of points can be important for some analytics or processes
 * that are bogged down by high point density. (Down sampling to max rate of one point per 3.5
 * seconds is a good default value).
 * <p>
 * A DownSampler can also be used to remove Points that are out of steps with the "regular repeat
 * rate" of a surveillance system. For example, if "good data" has a Point every 5 seconds than
 * finding two points separated by just 2 seconds is likely to indicate that the "out of step" point
 * is flawed.
