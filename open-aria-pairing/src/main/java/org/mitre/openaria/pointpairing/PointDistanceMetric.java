/**
 * This DistanceMetric measures "a" distance between two Points. The distance computed is a function
 * of both physical distance (measure in feet) AND temporal distance (measured in milliseconds).
 * <p>
 * A PointDistanceMetric returns: (timeCoef * timeDeltaInMillis) + (distCoef * distDeltaInFt).
 * <p>
 * Importantly, input Points are not required to be from the same moment in time. Therefore, this
 * distance metric can be used to search through any and all Points to identify Points that are
 * "close by".
 * <p>
 * A DistanceMetric can be used to find Points that are "close enough" to warrant more sophisticated
 * analysis (that usually requires the input Point to be from the same moment in Time). For example,
 * if you want to determine if two aircraft are within 500ft you would not use this distance metric
 * in isolation. This DistanceMetric cannot be relied on to compute the "500 ft" determination by
 * itself because it does not enforce the input Points to be from the same instant in Time. However,
 * this Metric can be used to quickly identify Pairs of Points that are simultaneously both close in
 * physical space and close in time. This is clearly the best place to begin trying to find Points
 * that are truly within 500 ft at one exact moment in time.
 * <p>
 * This class uses altitude information when computing the "distDeltaInFt" value. Choosing to use
 * altitude data is not "obviously correct" because (A) not all points have altitude data and (B) it
 * is surprisingly costly to compute the hypotenuse between the vertical and horizontal distance
 * components (which is necessary if the "distDeltaInFt" value must reflect the three dimensions of
 * latitude, longitude, and altitude).
