# The version number is redacted to discourage both running local builds that "feel official" AND manually updating the version number.
# The project's official version is determined automatically using GitHub actions in CI.
# This means most official artifacts (e.g., the shadow jar, docker images, helm charts etc.) should be generated by
# GitHub CI and downloaded directly from GitHub.
#
# However, GitHub Actions will NOT manufacture open-source artifacts.
# These artifacts are generated manually (for now)
# To run a local build that produces these artifacts you MUST set this version number.
